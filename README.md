Price Engine is a Java rebuild of a quick Python script I wrote for work.
Price Engine in Python was a quick build to get the TechSwap program off the ground.
This new engine has the polish and respectability of a real company's software.
This engine returns a price based upon market values on Apple mobile devices.

Please submit bug reports to cjsivley@gmail.com.

Directions----------------------------------------------------------
Check the boxes and options that reflect the device being sold.
Click "Get Price" button to generate the value.
The values are calculated and displayed in the nearby boxes.
It's foolproof as far as I know. If you break it, submit a bug report detailing
how you managed to break a simple calculator with a GUI overlay.
